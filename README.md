# Knowledge-Representation-in-WEB
A project that creates two python programs that are designed to handle XML and RDF data models respectively and give the ability to the user to visualise and edit the information.

**XML**
The program checks if the inputed xml file complies to the xml schema. When that is true the user can,
1) Display the xml information in a table format.
2) Enter new data to the file.
3) Filter the displayed data by day.

**RDF**
The program loads the rdf file and gives the ability to the user to,
1) Choose a department from what is defined in the rdf file and display information regarding its personel and students.
2) Add more data in the file.
3) Display all the triples that include the URI that the user inputs.
